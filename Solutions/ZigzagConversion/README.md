- This implementation takes a string and rearranges its characters in a zigzag pattern across a given number of rows:
1. If the number of rows is 1 or greater than or equal to the string length, the string is returned as it is.
2. Otherwise, the code creates an array of character arrays, one for each row, and fills them by simulating the zigzag traversal: moving down through the rows, then up again, and repeating this pattern while adding characters. The direction changes whenever the top or bottom row is reached.
3. After all characters are placed into their respective rows, the rows are concatenated into a single final string.
4. Memory used for the intermediate rows is freed before returning the result.
